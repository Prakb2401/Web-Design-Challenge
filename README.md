### Web Design Challenge

## General information
In this challenge I used HTML, CSS, Boostrap todevelop my first website using data from my Python API challenge. I started off by converting the Cities.csv from the Python API challenge to a HTML file. Following that I began developing the index.html by starting with the dropdown menu. Then i developed the pages for each of the scatterplot from the API challenge. After developing the code for all the HTML files i made developed a CSS file to make the website look more appealing.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Boostrap
* Jupyter notebook/Pandas
* VS Code

# Important note/ slash some issues
* Sometimes the go to home button does not function properly. To solve refesh the page and click again.
* Drop down menu items are not aligned properly. Still working on that part.
